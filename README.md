# MineSweeper-
recreating the old game MineSweeper
# Description
The objective of the game is to find all the safe squares without running into the mines. The number located on the top of each square tells you how many mines are surrounding each safe square(green = safe). If one mine get triggered your run is over. Each game is randomly generated so, no two games will be alike. So, tell me will you blow up or glow up?
